## About

A snake game replicated from the famous Nokia phone game application. 
It contains improvised graphics but the gameplay will be almost the same.
<br><br>
This will be my first ever game project in python as a software engineer.
This showcases my knowledge about object-oriented design, and basic uses of 
the fundamentals of python language.
